# Quick Start Guide - Crop Advisory App

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Get all packages
flutter pub get
```

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Get API Keys

### **Gemini AI API Key** (Required)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### **OpenWeatherMap API Key** (Required for Weather)
1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Navigate to "API keys" section
4. Copy your API key (or generate new one)

### **Supabase Credentials** (Required for Backend)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new project (or use existing)
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy:
   - Project URL
   - Anon/Public Key

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Replace with your actual keys
SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key_here
```

**⚠️ Important**: Never commit the `.env` file with real keys to Git!

---

## 🔨 Step 4: Generate Code

Run build_runner to generate required provider code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This generates:
- `*.g.dart` files for all Riverpod providers
- `*.freezed.dart` files (if using Freezed)
- JSON serialization code

---

## ▶️ Step 5: Run the App

```bash
# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Or run in debug mode with hot reload
flutter run --debug

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Core Features

### Test Gemini AI Integration
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Chatbot
3. Send a message: "How do I grow rice?"
4. Verify AI response is generated

### Test Weather API
1. Allow location permission
2. Navigate to Weather screen
3. Verify current weather displays
4. Check 5-day forecast

### Test Notifications
1. Allow notification permission
2. Go to Settings
3. Enable daily weather notifications
4. Schedule a test reminder

### Test Theme Switching
1. Go to Settings/Profile
2. Toggle dark mode switch
3. Verify theme changes
4. Restart app - theme should persist

## 🎨 Step 7: Customize (Optional)

### Change App Colors
Edit `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`:
```dart
static const Color primary = Color(0xFF2E7D32); // Your color
```

### Add New Feature
1. Create screen in `lib/features/your_feature/screens/`
2. Create provider in `lib/features/your_feature/providers/`
3. Use Gemini service for AI features:
```dart
final geminiService = ref.read(geminiServiceProvider);
final response = await geminiService.sendMessage(
  message: "Your query",
  language: "English",
);
```
